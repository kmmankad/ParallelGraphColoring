# ParallelGraphColoring
General experiments with parallel **graph coloring** algorithms

What this repo contains:

* A simple serial implementation in C++ (Greedy First Fit)
* A CUDA based implementation of the topology driven Greedy & Speculative First Fit Algorithm described in **Xuhao Chen et al., Efficient and High-quality Sparse Graph Coloring on the GPU, Tech. Rep. NUDT-CS-2016-003, 2016**
* A CUDA based implementation inspired by the existing cuSparse Implementation as described in this [NVIDIA WhitePaper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/publications/nvr-2015-001.pdf). _TODO_

...and a discussion of this effort in general.
