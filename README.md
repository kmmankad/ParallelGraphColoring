# ParallelGraphColoring
General experiments with parallel **graph coloring** algorithms

What this repo contains:

* A simple serial implementation in C++
* A Multicore CPU (OpenMP) implementation 
* A GPU (OpenACC) implementation
* A CUDA based implementation inspired by the existing cuSparse Implementation
* A CUDA based implementation of the algorithms described in "Efficient and High quality Sparse Graph Coloring" by X. Chen et. al

...and a discussion of this effort in general.
